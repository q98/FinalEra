# Explanation of the repository

I have decided to open source my 3D multiplayer browser game that I made during the year 2019. The technology I made shows how to do complex video game development under great constraints and for unique goals which are not likely to be found in traditional settings. I publicly released the source code so that enthusiasts can use it to learn how to produce their own 3D multiplayer games; or individuals can use the knowledge shared here to aid them in their own unique journeys—augment their beings and lives. And "information wants to be free.": So sayeth the programming hacker rhetoric and literature that I grew up on. I include a chronological list of URLs that provide context for the circumstances that the engineering effort was surrounded by, giving you an understanding of the technical, architectural, and strategic decisions that were made—*that had to be made*. The provided context is more useful than any technical instruction that would tell you how to install the software development dependencies: for you to understand the contourless engineering philosophy and perspective that was used to create the technology. It also gives you a picture and narrative of the multiple changes, iterations, and transformations that the product experienced.

The game was made with many intentional and acceptable oversights which likely caused detrimental errors such as unplanned artifacts that would arise from an unexpected public release of the source code. So if you find passwords or something inappropriate like that in this repository, you should, like, totally tell me or something (I already know that the Heroku URL used to host a private test production version is exposed). Regarding the licensing aspect of the free release or the legality of it, you, dear reader, can safely assume a very permissive allowance and usage of the software and its complementary structures and assets. As I see no harm in that.
